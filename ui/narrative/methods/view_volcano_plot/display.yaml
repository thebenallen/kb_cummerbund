    <p>View interactive volcano plot. This app takes a differential expression statistics object as an input. The differential expression statistics object can be obtained by running the app View CummeRbund Plots. It creates an interactive volcano plot.
    The slider in the volcano  plot can be used to select appropriate q_value and fold change cutoff and display number of genes and their functional annotation. </p>
